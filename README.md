# 🌍 Simple Travelers Blog

**Simple Travelers** is a personal travel blog built with **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript** designed to share
mine and my partner's couple's hiking adventures, remote destinations, and travel tips from around the world.

Hosted on **AWS Amplify**, the blog is automatically deployed on each push to the `main` branch, making the publishing
workflow seamless and efficient.
